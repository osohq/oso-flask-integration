# oso: authorization as code [Flask Integration Example]

oso allows you to write policy as code, tightly integrated
with application code, logic, and data, and provides a simple
way to enforce authorization on all requests.

## Example

This repository contains an example application using oso
and the oso Flask integration to secure requests.

The application itself is a simple [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
web server, implementing an expenses application.

We used the ``oso`` & ``flask_oso`` libraries.

We have already partially implemented the core functionality;
some is left for you to complete.
